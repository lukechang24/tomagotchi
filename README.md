# How to Play
The goal of the game is to keep your pet alive by making sure its hunger, boredom, or sleepiness level stay below 10. You can feed your pet, play with it, or let it sleep to decrease its respective levels.

# My Favorite Parts
I enjoyed using set interval to simulate a game that is played in real-life time. Designing the look of my tomagotchi game was also fun, as I improved my css skills through this project. I also took time to draw out each animation in my game, which allowed me to have more control over what my tomagotchi could do.
